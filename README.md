# Palo Alto Networks Reference Architectures

Reference architectures apply a platform-centric approach to secure designs for key customer environments, including SaaS, cloud, and data center. Based on validated configurations and best practices, they provide technical and design guidance in support of technical customer engagements.

 These templates support the Scaled Design Model and Shared Design Model as described in the **Reference Architecture Guide for Microsoft Azure**.
 
 The proper use of each template is described in the deployment guides:
 - **Deployment Guide For Microsoft Azure - Scaled Design Model**
 - **Deployment Guide For Microsoft Azure - Shared Design Model**
